Here at <strong>RockCCTV</strong>&nbsp; - We only install Digital IP cameras - as we consider installing an analogue system today would not give our customers the desired level of future proofing that we as a business would want to provide. POE ( Power over Ethernet ) gives unrivalled clarity to your recordings.<br><br>
We locate your recorder box in your loft - recording all activity for at least a rolling three weeks. Should anything occur in that time you can always be assured that it will have been recorded and retained. The recorder is best protected from the dusty environment of your loft by being housed in a beautiful wooden box. We've even thought of pine cones glued to the inside to keep the spiders at bay. 
<br><br>Our prices are very competitive. Send us some photos of your house ( or business ) and after a few questions about your home - We'll probably be able to give you a quote over the phone.<br>
<br><strong>Typically we recommend a 4 camera Sannce system :-</strong><br><br>

<center><strong>Camera Systems</strong></center><br>
<strong>Sannce</strong> and <strong>Annke</strong> systems have built in motion detection and can identify movement across the field of view, marking the recordings with movement a different colour.
<br><br>Although we prefer <strong>Sannce</strong> and <strong>Annke</strong> systems, we are also able to install other camera systems - please contact us for more information.<br><br>
The wooden box has a hole cut in the bottom. Only when the temperature of one of the chips inside the NVR exceeds 45&#176;C does a filtered fan kick in to add additional cooling. This stops unnecessary dirt being brought into the box.

<center><strong>Camera Location Survey</strong></center><br>
We provide a Camera Location Survey prior to installing your camera system - although sending us photographs of your desired locations in advance is always helpful. During our survey we can show you a live feed from one of our customers - who has very kindly agreed to us sharing his feed. This shows the clarity of the video from the cameras that is being recorded. Depending on the location of your property you might be restricted as to what you can record within the field of your cameras - schools are of course of particular relevance.

<br><br>
 <strong>Share the camera system and the installation cost with your neighbour.</strong><br>
 When you set up your control box access account - you give your neighbour access to the account - and then they can watch - and remote view all four cameras. This benefits both neighbours - as it halves the price for both of you, but most importantly it gives better coverage than two independent two camera systems. It also means that people can't sneak up your neighbours path and then get access to the front of your house out of sight of your cameras.
<br><br>Whether or not you get your neighbours on board - Our prices are very competitive</p>

"Greg and his team at <strong>RockCCTV</strong> installed our camera system simply and quicky with the minimum of fuss. He explained everything to us and even assisted over the phone the following day as I tried to get the video feed onto my wife's iPhone. I know he'll always return my calls. <br><br>Clean, professional and respectful - I couldn't recommend Greg and his team more highly."

"I have purchased a few cameras etc... from <strong>RockCCTV</strong> over the last few years and the advice I have received has always been first class. I have just purchased another camera and a new DVR and I cannot believe how good it is compared to a previously top-end DVR I purchased 9 years ago that cost 10 times as much! This company really does outstrip quality, and standards that I have come across before and at really good prices. Many thanks for your great service!"<br><br>

“Sometimes you don't fully believe good reviews but with <strong>RockCCTV</strong> you should. They fitted my 4 camera system over a year ago but have a local issue with my internet connection, not their quality equipment. I didn't expect the brilliant customer care provided by Greg and his team, knowledgeable and patient. When I have fitted a new lengthy Ethernet cable he is still willing to revisit my problem - don't hesitate to use <strong>RockCCTV</strong>”.

"Anyone looking to purchase a CCTV system will probably have had the same nightmares as I did. So many conflicting bits of information and wild claims of what the system will do. After two months of searching, I stumbled on <strong>RockCCTV</strong>. Immediately, I was impressed with the amount of knowledge they had, using real CCTV video links to existing installations it was easy to see what I was going to get. After a chat with Greg, discussing my requirements, I went with their recommendation and purchased a six camera set-up, along with a DVR equipped with a 1TB disk. I have had the system running now for around two months and I am have been very happy with the camera quality and DVR software. Several friends have seen it and said it is so much better than the systems they are using.
<br><br>
I can recommend <strong>RockCCTV</strong> without the slightest hesitation and with their help, I can view my home either on my mobile or via any browser, even from abroad."<br><br>
